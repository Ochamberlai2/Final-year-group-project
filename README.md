# Final Year Group Project

This repository contains the Unity3D project and source code for my final year group project from my Computer Game Programming(BSc) degree. During this project, I worked as part of a team of 4, split between two Computer Game Design students and 2 Computer Game Programming students, myself included.

A colony simulation/resource management game, inspired by the likes of Dwarf fortress and Rimworld. Written in C# and using the Unity3D engine, players must build a colony and survive in a land where agriculture isn't possible. Gain resources by hunting the dinosaurian wildlife which has adapted to become one with the local landscape and only sees your colony as just another food source.

In this project, I was responsible for creating the AI behaviours of the colonist agents; as well as any of the colony building functionality and any UI elements that came along with this.

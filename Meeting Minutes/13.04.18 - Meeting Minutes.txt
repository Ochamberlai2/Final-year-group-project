Discussed previous weeks work. 
Douglas had completed his balancing tasks
Ross had completed most of his tasks however the barracks re-design has not been completed due to the final project
deadline on friday. His task to create the being hunted Icon was finished but passed to Douglas in order to create a 3d model of this.
Daniel has not completed any of his work again this week due to focusing on final project.
All of Oliver's work was completed this week.

Discussed re-designing how different UI menus are accessed, created tasks to this effect.

Re-design of some UI elements will be effected this week and further playtesting will be completed. Daniel and Oliver intend to have
their tasks finished by Sunday afternoon. Daniel believes that his tasks will be completed by Saturday evening and Oliver will then
complete his when Daniel is finished. This will allow Douglas ample time to playtest the game.

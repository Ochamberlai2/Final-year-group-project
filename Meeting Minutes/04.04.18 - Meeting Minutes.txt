Discussed previous weeks playtesting feedback + bugs

discussed changing the barracks building, possibly removing it in favour of context buttons appearing when clicking to hunt dinosaurs. This should
be more intuitive.

went through previous weeks work and finished off previous sprint.

Although a full weeks sprint has been created, due to the deadline for final project being only a week away, we do not expect that all of the
work from members will be completed.

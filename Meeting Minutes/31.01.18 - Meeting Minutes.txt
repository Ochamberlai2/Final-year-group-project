in order to give more variance in the game world.

12:00 - Douglas and Ross left


14:00 - Oliver and Daniel have a meeting with Chris to discuss an issue regarding the nav mesh system

Where we were believing that the function used to build the navmeshes was per surface, it was in fact fact building all at once,meaning that
when we were calling the function for every tile, the function was baking every navmesh 81 times when instantiating a map of 9x9 tiles.

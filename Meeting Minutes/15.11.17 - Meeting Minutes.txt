Members in attendance: Oliver Chamberlain, Daniel Jamieson, Ross Warren, Douglas Simpson


Discussed and reviewed the previous week's work.

Discussed eliminating the farm building due to it not really fitting with the game's justification for why the wood and stone etc cannot be
used as building materials and why materials are harvested from the dinosaurs. 

Daniel asked Douglas for a list of which tiles are able to be neighbouring tiles on each orthogonal direction for the terrain tiles. This is required alongside the tiles
themselves for his task this week to complete the terrain implementation.

Clarified Ross' UI designs and requested alterations.

Make different coloured capes for each colonist type


Addendum -

On Sunday:
	Oliver and Douglas discussed whether it is more beneficial to the game to recycle and recolour assets for the colonist armour or to make seperate models for each
	armour type. Oliver's argument was that in terms of time efficiency it would be most effective for the project to recycle old assets and re-visit this should a time
	become available to do so. Douglas' argument was that quote "Palette swapping is a lazy waste of potential". No resolution was decided. This will be a topic at the next group meeting.
On Monday: 
	Oliver, Douglas and Ross picked up the previous discussion about recycling assets. Ross' opinion was that he assumed that we would recolour and recycle the assets and then suggested that
	this should be a topic of the next group meeting. Ross also presented some evidence of other games doing this, such as runescape which shares a similar low poly art style with a 3rd person
	overhead camera. Douglas' opinion is that recolouring the assets for the colonist leg armour would not work, because he has already modelled some chest pieces
	and would rather model colonist leg armour outside of the assigned development time than use placeholder graphics.
